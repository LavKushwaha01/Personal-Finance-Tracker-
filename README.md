A modern web application to help you **track your personal finances**, record income & expenses, and get a visual overview of your budget and spending habits.  
This project is built using **Next.js (React), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS** — making it fast, responsive, and scalable for future upgrades.

##  Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LavKushwaha01/Personal-Finance-Tracker-.git
cd Personal-Finance-Tracker-
```
```bash
2. Install Dependencies
This project is configured with Bun but also works with npm/yarn:
Using Bun (recommended)
bun install
Using npm
npm install
```

```bash
3. Environment Setup
Before running locally, create a .env file using the example (if provided):

cp .env.example .env
Configure the database connection (if using Prisma & a database) — e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.
```

```bash
4. Run the Development Server
npm run dev
# or
bun run dev
Your app will be available at:

http://localhost:3000
```

##  How It Works (Workflows)
- User interacts with UI components (forms, buttons)

- Frontend collects input (transaction, category)

- Next.js triggers API routes (under /app/api)

- API handlers forward requests to Prisma client

- Prisma talks to the database to create/read data

- Response is returned to UI and re-renders updated data

## UI Workflow
_ The dashboard fetches a list of transactions

- It categorizes them into income vs expenses

- Totals and summaries are computed in frontend logic

- Tailwind utility classes style components responsively
